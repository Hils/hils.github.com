        <p>Hello. This is a thing made by <a href="http://twitter.com/nternetinspired">Seth Warburton</a>, using the awesome <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>
        <p>The intention is to provide you with a solid basis on which to build your own awesome Jekyll-powered blog. It's the new hotness, dontcha know.</p>
        <h2>All the buzzwords!</h2>
        <p>All the latest buzzwords are built-in; responsive, mobile-first, content first, html5, css3, LESS, static-site-thingy, blah, blah, blahâ€¦</p>
        <p>What's more, I left out all the old boring stuff.</p>
        <h2>Easy, peasy, lemon, squeezy &reg;</h2>
        <p>If you can figure out how to create a <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account and have the basics of html and css and copying/pasting in your skillset, you should be fine from here on in. Just in case, I wrote a few things down, so if you want you can go check out <a href="/archive.html">the archive</a>. Or just check out the newest articles below.</p>
