First up, you need a Github account. You already have on eof those right? Great.

To get started you can just fork this repository to your account, then simply rename it so it starts with your github username, not mine (mines nternetinspired, your's is something else).

A few minutes later (up to 10 apparently) Github will be serving your site up at yourusername.github.com. Sorted.

##How do I change stuff?

<p data-pullquote="If you are going to use Disqus comments on articles you need to have set up a Disqus account…">Easy stuff first. Site-wide configuration junk is stored in the configuration file, _config.yml. Edit that inserting your name, site name, email address, etc. If you are going to use Disqus comments on articles you need to have set up a Disqus account (obviously) and you can then place the username in this file to. At that point Disqus comment trickery will automagically appear in your posts.</p>

##I don't like blue
Good. Don't make your site look the same as everyone else who forked this thing, that would be super lame. You now have 2 options;

1. Edit style.LESS - the variable for all the colour junk is right at the top, just change that and re-compile that file. 
2. Edit style.css - If less scares you use serach/replace to swap out the colour in the css instead. And then think about using LESS next time.
